&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, reader. My name is Kyle Glick. I'm a 21 year old male originally from DeKalb, Illinois. I'm a senior at the College of Charleston in Charleston (CofC) in Charleston, South Carolina, working towards a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. I also work as an intern on the SPARCRequest development team for the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Biomedical Informatics Center (BMIC) where we develop applications to help medical researchers manage research and patient information. My hobbies include both playing and developing video games, Netflix, 3-D environment art and modeling, and playing with my two wonderful cats: Bootsy and Tiger. I'm also quite the food fanatic. One of my favorite parts about visiting a new place is experiencing the diverse food cultures and experiencing new flavors. I'm also a long-time musician - going on 13 years now. I've played in a variety of groups, including jazz, concert, and rock. I currently play for both the CofC Pep Band and Wind Ensemble. I'm also a leader in the CofC chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery and a proud member of the CofC chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon.
