### 4.6
_**Suggest how an engineer responsible for drawing up a system requirements specification  might keep track of the relationships between functional and non-functional requirements.**_

---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to keep track of the relationships between functional and non-functional requirements of a system, the engineer should ideally devise a table or diagram. The engineer could list the functional system requirements, and for each functional requirement, specify the nonfunctional requirements that coincide with it.

As an example:
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="col-sm-6">Functional Requirements</th>
      <th class="col-sm-6">Related Nonfunctional Requirements</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>User should be able to deposit checks in ATM</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Service should be available at any ATM</li>
          <li>Transactions should be made in a reasonable amount of time</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

_**Using your knowledge of how an ATM is used, develop a set of use cases that could serve as a basis for understanding the requirements for an ATM system.**_
