### Response
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My team, **Don't Test me**, has made steady progress building our automated test suite for Canvas LMS. Our team initially struggled with getting Canvas set up and running on an Ubuntu 16.04 VirtualBox image. While we originally thought Canvas had very helpful, specific details for setting up their application, we quickly realized that their quick start guide was outdated and some information was left out of the guide, despite being necessary to set up Canvas. After many, many hours of struggling, we finally got Canvas running on our machines.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting Canvas up and running, we were tasked with developing 25 use cases for our test suite. We've found this process somewhat challenging, due to Canvas's significant number of dependencies and very large, complicated models. Most of our test cases seem to revolve around numeric methods, such as those dealing with scores and grades.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also started developing our script and getting 5 tests running within the last week or so. In order to get our first tests running, we had to install a Gem which allows us to negate the need for a database by allowing us to add minor snippets of code to the models we're using to provide local attributes, instead of connecting to a database through Rails' Active Record. We also built a generic testing class that we called _Testatron_ which provide a simple interface for running our tests and handles all I/O operations, keepign our test files simple. While dealing with some of the Canvas dependencies and the database connection issue was frustrating, I originally thought this step would be much more difficult than it was. The script has also been much easier than expected. We were able to iterate over our test files, run them, and build our HTML in a very short amount of relatively simple Bash code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, our team is in a solid place. We have a running script with a nice, Bootstrap table report, and simple, easy-to-write tests. Our team is working very well togther, with everyone contributing to different parts of the project and providing valuable feedback to one another. We're coordinating through Slack and we're not having any issues managing out GitHub merges.
