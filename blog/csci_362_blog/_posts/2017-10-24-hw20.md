_**Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?**_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complex system is consists not only of its components, but also of how its components interact with one another. This is the key factor that makes it impossible to infer the emergent properties of the system from the properties of its components. While each of its components might perform well and be reliable, usable, safe, and secure, the system as a whole may not be. If the system's components do not interact with one another with the same emergent properties that they hold, then the system as a whole will suffer and will not meet the same standards as its components
