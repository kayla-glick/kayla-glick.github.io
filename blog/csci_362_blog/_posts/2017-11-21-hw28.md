### 25.10
_**Describe five factors that engineers would take into account during the process of building a release of a large software system.**_

---

1. **Competition** - Competing systems may have implemented features that could cause a loss of market share if requested by customers and not implemented in a release.

2. **Marketing Requirements** - Marketing may set deadlines which, if not followed, can cause backlash from consumers. Similarly, marketing often makes note of major feature changes to create anticipation for a new release.

3. **Platform Changes** - When various popular Operating Systems release an update, it's often necessary to create a new release for patching any compatibility issues with the new update.

4. **Technical Quality of the System** - If faults / bugs exist in the current system, it is often necessary to create quick patch releases to deal with reported issues.

5. **Documentation** - It's important to create documentation for the system for future maintainability and so that users know what changes have been made during a release. Each new feature, as well as bug fixes, should be documented.
