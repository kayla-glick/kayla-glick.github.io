### 21.4
_**Explain why an object-oriented approach to software development may not be suitable for real-time systems.**_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real-time systems generally take the form of process-oriented systems with interactions between some sort of sensor or "observer" and some sort of hardware or other components which receive signals from them in the form of "reactions".
Because these system interact between specific hardware components, it's less useful to incorporating virtual objects through OO design. Rather, these systems work best when handling received signals from one or more components and processing/reacting to those signals, then sending other signals to other components directly. Additionally, object-oriented systems require higher over-head than process-oriented systems. Because OO involves information hiding and managing access to object data, extra code, and therefore time, is required to retrieve the data from objects.
