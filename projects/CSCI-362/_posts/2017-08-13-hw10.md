### 5.3
_**You have been asked to develop a system that will help with planning large-scale events and parties such as weddings, graduation celebrations, and birthday parties. Using an activity diagram, model the process context for such a system that shows the activities involved in planning a party (booking a venue, organizing invitations, etc.) and the system elements that might be used at each stage.**_

### 5.5
_**Develop a sequence diagram showing the interactions involved when a student registers for a course in a university. Courses may have limited enrollment, so the registration process must include checks that places are available. Assume that the student accesses an electronic course catalog to find out about available courses.**_

### 5.8
_**Draw a sequence diagram for the same system. Explain why you might want to develop both activity and sequence diagrams when modeling the behavior of a system.**_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's important to use both Sequence and Activity diagrams when modeling the behavior of a system because each diagram provides an important, but at the same time incomplete description of the system events. Activity diagrams provide an easy-to-read model of event flow with fewer technical details. It's best use it to model Work Flow, but not necessarily the interactions taking place within the system. Sequence Diagrams are the opposite. They tend to be more technical and provide more detailed information about how the system is going about its various events. It tends to poorly show the overall Work Flow of a system, but it provides valuable technical implementation details.
